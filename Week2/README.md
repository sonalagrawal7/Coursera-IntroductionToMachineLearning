# Basics of Model Learning

In this module we will be discussing the mathematical basis of learning deep networks. Weâ€™ll first work through how we define the issue of learning deep networks as a minimization problem of a mathematical function. After defining our mathematical goal, we will introduce validation methods to estimate real-world performance of the learned deep networks. We will then discuss how gradient descent, a classical technique in optimization, can be used to achieve this mathematical goal. Finally, we will discuss both why and how stochastic gradient descent is used in practice to learn deep networks.
