# Recurrent Neural Networks for Natural Language Processing

This week will cover the application of neural networks to natural language processing (NLP), from simple neural models to the more complex. The fundamental concept of word embeddings is discussed, as well as how such methods are employed within model learning and usage for several NLP applications. A wide range of neural NLP models are also discussed, including recurrent neural networks, and specifically long short-term memory (LSTM) models.
