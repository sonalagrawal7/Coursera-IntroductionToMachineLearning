Like computer vision, natural
language processing has undergone a significant
transformation with introduction
of deep learning. Here, we'll introduce a few
of the relevant concepts. In particular, Module 4 introduced the concept
of a word embedding, which is a vectorized
representation of a word that carry some meaning. Here, we'll have some fun with some pre-trained word
embeddings and see how we can use them to find similar words and
solve word analogies. We'll also train a very simple neural network model
that learns how to use word embeddings to predict the sentiment of
some movie reviews. We'll conclude with
a brief overview of recurrent neural
networks in PyTorch. For the assignment, you'll train a few different
types of models on a top classification data set and compare the performance.
