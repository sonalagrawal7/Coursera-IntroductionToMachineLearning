# Simple Introduction to Machine Learning

The focus of this module is to introduce the concepts of machine learning with as little mathematics as possible. We will introduce basic concepts in machine learning, including logistic regression, a simple but widely employed machine learning (ML) method. Also covered is multilayered perceptron (MLP), a fundamental neural network. The concept of deep learning is discussed, and also related to simpler models.


## Learning Objectives
1. Explain why machine learning is exciting.
2. Recognize the characteristics of the logistic regression model.
